This is a collection of code to run the UM tracking scheme

1. Get the tracking scheme

The source scripts and binaries are downloadable from 
http://www.cycstats.org/tracks/mozart/

Read all the readmes, run all the tests
The tracking scheme is pretty well documented

2. Format the data

You will probably have data stored in some sort of netcdf file
This will need to be extracted & reformatted into a file in the
"ausmap" format with appropriate headers.

Example fortran binaries to do this are in the format directory

As part of this you also need to create a topography file in the same format
from the same data source

3. Run the tracking scheme

An example shell script is in the run folder
This uses input files that are in the config files
and has many parameters specific in the shell script

Common projections I use:
proj 240 = Equivalent to ~ 0.5 degrees at 30S
proj 100 = Equivalent to ~ 1.5 degrees at 30S

Common intensity thresholds I use
Lows, radius 5 dgerees - cv 0.15 or 0.25
Lows, radius 2 degrees - cv 1
Highs, radius 10 degrees - cv 0.075
